# SQLite Viewer for Ubuntu

A lightweight PyQt6 desktop SQLite database viewer targeting Ubuntu desktops. The app lets you inspect tables, run ad-hoc queries, and export results—packaged for distribution via Python wheels or Debian packages.

## Features

- Browse tables and view row data with pagination
- Run custom SQL queries with syntax highlighting and CSV export
- Display table schema metadata
- Persistent recent files list for quick access
- Debian package builder for Ubuntu (Python-dependent bundle)

## Prerequisites

This application requires the following system libraries to be installed on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libxcb-cursor0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-xkb1
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# create & activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install in editable mode with dev extras
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Launch the viewer:

```bash
sqliteviewer /path/to/database.sqlite
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Packaging

- Build wheel + sdist: `python -m build`
- Build Debian package: `./scripts/build_deb.sh`
- Generated packages are placed in `dist/`

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) validates formatting, runs tests, and ensures packaging succeeds on Ubuntu.
